### Purpose

- A practice project on Full- stack Angular/Typescript (Frontend) with Java Spring Boot (Backend)
- Generally done by seperating angular and spring boot into two separate projects.
- Spring boot is used to build a REST or GraphQL backend API. This will connect to any databases, for this I will be using MySQL.
- This allows for seperate team (large enterprises) and ability for seperate deployment.
